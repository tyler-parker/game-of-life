    <h1 class="title">Rules of The Game</h1>
    <p class="text">The Game of Life, created by mathematician John Conway, is a cellular automaton simulation. It follows four simple rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
      <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
      <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
      <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
    </ul>
